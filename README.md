# SUSU-IN-THE-MAZE
# Top-Down Adventure Game

This is a **top-down adventure game** built using the [LÃ–VE 2D framework](https://love2d.org/). The game features a dynamic player-controlled character navigating a map, interacting with objects, and switching between various game states, such as menu, play, pause, and options.

## Features

- **Dynamic Game States**: Includes `menu`, `play`, `pause`, `options`, and `end` states for seamless gameplay.
- **Interactive Menus**: Navigate through options like starting the game, toggling sound, and exiting.
- **Player Mechanics**:
  - Four-directional movement with animations.
  - Collision detection with walls and map boundaries.
- **Game Map**:
  - A dynamic map loaded via `Tiled` (using the `STI` library).
  - Includes static and interactive elements like doors and walls.
- **Sound Effects and Music**: Background music and button interaction sounds.
- **Camera**: Smooth camera movement that follows the player across the map.
